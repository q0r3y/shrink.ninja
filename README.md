## Serverless URL shortener

My objective was to create an incredibly simple URL shortening service. I frequently use this service when I'm bouncing between multiple devices. It provides a simple and efficient way to share web links, whether it's for inter-device use or sharing with others.

Recently, I streamlined this project to its essential elements and transitioned it to a serverless architecture using Cloudflare Pages and Workers. This eliminates the need for hosting expenses, and maintenance has become nearly non-existent.

I've designed the user experience to be as effortless as possible. When you're on a webpage and need to transfer it to another device or share it with someone, simply prepend "shrink.ninja/" to the beginning of the web address and press Enter. You'll receive a "nin.sh" link and a QR code, making it incredibly convenient to share links.

To me, this approach is much simpler than visiting a traditional URL shortening service website, navigating through unnecessary complexities, possibly having to create an account before using their service, configuring various options, and then finally getting your shortened URL.

Instructions:

    1. Type "shrink.ninja/" in front of the URL you want to shorten.
    2. Press Enter.
    3. Copy the shortened URL from the shrink.ninja website.
    4. Paste the shortened URL wherever you want to use it.
